//! M9-α-9 — typed envelope helpers for α-7's once-SSE-only events.
//!
//! Per the M9-α (Sole Transport) ADR (`docs/M9-ALPHA-SOLE-TRANSPORT-ADR.md`)
//! the WebSocket transport is the sole chat transport. SSE has been
//! deleted in α-5/α-6 (atomic with the web bundle). The 5 events α-7
//! surfaced as previously-SSE-only have already been migrated to typed
//! v1 envelopes; this module is the canonical home for the helpers
//! that emit those envelopes (turn/started/completed addenda, file/
//! attached, session/event-bridged).
//!
//! Post-α-5/α-6 the helpers are not yet wired into the new WS lifecycle
//! handlers (that's a separate follow-up). They retain their unit tests
//! and will be reused as-is when the lifecycle handlers re-emit them.
//!
//! **Scope per UPCR-2026-014** (the addendum landing in this PR):
//!
//! 1. `session_result` — final session-completion identity (committed_seq +
//!    message_id + client_message_id) for the closing assistant row.
//!    Carried as `TurnCompletedEvent.session_result` so it rides on the
//!    existing `turn/completed` envelope (not a new method).
//! 2. `file_attached` — per-turn file attachment from a tool's
//!    `files_to_send`. Carried as the new `file/attached` envelope.
//! 3. `tokens_in` / `tokens_out` — final token usage for the turn.
//!    Carried as `TurnCompletedEvent.tokens_in/out`.
//! 4. `topic` on `turn/start` — sub-topic suffix for multi-topic specs.
//!    Carried as `TurnStartedEvent.topic`.
//! 5. `/api/sessions/:id/events/stream` — legacy free-form SSE event
//!    stream. Bridged onto a new `session/event` envelope that wraps the
//!    legacy `type` + payload so WS-only clients keep observing each
//!    frame as it gradually lifts onto a typed v1 envelope.
//!
//! **Coexistence invariants** (same as α-2 / α-3 / α-4):
//! - SSE delivery is unchanged — the helpers in this module ONLY append
//!   to the ledger; the SSE wire path runs through whichever channel
//!   reporter / handler emitted the original frame.
//! - Ledger appends are best-effort. A failure does not affect the SSE
//!   path or the agent loop.
//! - WS clients dedupe by stable identity (turn_id + session_id +
//!   committed_seq) so a client connected to both transports collapses
//!   the duplicate into one logical update.
//!
