//! Peer-agent staging, addressing, and parked-prompt plumbing.
//!
//! Lifted VERBATIM out of the `api`-gated `api::ui_protocol` tree (Phase 3 of
//! bringing peer-agent goal into `octos chat`, mirroring the Phase 0 autonomy
//! extraction and the Phase 3 `crate::contracts` extraction). No logic changed:
//! only module placement and item visibility (`pub(crate)`), so the serve/WS
//! path keeps calling the exact same functions through a glob re-import.
//!
//! What stayed behind in `api::ui_protocol`: everything that touches `AppState`
//! or a `WsConnection` — `register_peer_wire_session`, `evict_peer_wire_session`,
//! `wake_master_on_peer_awaiting_input`, `write_peer_result_if_peer_session`,
//! the `peer/prepare` + `peer/gather` RPC handlers, the fleet-synthesis
//! scheduler, the model-lane provider builders (they need `SessionRuntime`),
//! and `build_peer_close_callback`. Those are genuinely serve-shaped.
//!
//! What moved: the pure filesystem/registry layer that a peer HOST needs
//! regardless of transport —
//!
//! * addressing: [`peer_slug_is_safe`], [`name_to_slug`], [`staged_peer_dir`],
//!   [`resolve_peer_name_to_slug`], [`peer_slug_and_profile`]
//! * fd-anchored peer-file I/O: [`peer_io`]
//! * staging: [`stage_peer`] and the `peer_handoff` callback builder
//! * the blackboard reader + `peer_list` renderer
//! * the parked-prompt projection and [`peer_respond_resolve`]
//! * the process-global [`peer_wire_registry`] mapping `"{profile}:peer:{slug}"`
//!   to the peer's live `SessionKey`
//!
//! The wire registry and `crate::contracts::contract_stores()` are BOTH
//! process-global `OnceLock`s. That is the whole reason a single-process
//! `octos chat --peers` can work: the peer's own approval/question requester
//! registers its oneshot in the same registry the master's `peer_respond`
//! resolves it from.

/// carries a REGULAR `result.md` has nothing left to wait for and is adopted
/// — `mark_completed` with the blackboard file as its output — instead of
/// idling in `Parked` until a client happens to gather it.
///
/// Slug extraction: the row's `tool_call_id` IS the wire key

/// colons, so the split is on the LAST `:peer:` occurrence (`rsplit_once`).

/// through [`staged_peer_dir`], so a malformed or hostile key can never steer
/// the lookup out of `peers/`.

/// slug lookup the #8 sweep had:
///
/// 1. **Full wire-key match.** The row's `tool_call_id` must EQUAL
///    `peer_wire_key(expected_profile, slug)` — the `rsplit` slug extraction
///    alone left the prefix unverified, so a key forged under a DIFFERENT
///    profile (`evil:peer:ourslug`) still resolved OUR staged dir.
/// 2. **Originator cross-check.** The row's `parent_session_key` must equal
///    the staged dir's `originator` record when that record exists; with no
///    record (a profile-scoped `peer_prepare` records none — see
///    `peer_send_input` authorization) it must equal `expected_master_session`
///    instead. A stale row replayed under another session is refused.
/// 3. **Persisted task-id binding.** Registration writes `peers/<slug>/
///    task-id` ([`persist_peer_task_id_binding`]); when present, adoption
///    requires it to EQUAL the row's task id, so a parked row whose wire key
///    names a peer but whose task was never staged into THAT dir cannot claim
///    its result. An ABSENT file permits legacy (pre-#14) fallback to checks
///    1+2 only for a unique Parked wire-key candidate with no new staging
///    finalization gate. Invalid identity files never permit this fallback.
///
/// ## B: settle-binding restoration BEFORE `mark_completed`
///
/// The change-feed settle listener resolves the task→goal binding from the
/// IN-MEMORY `goal_task_ledger_bindings` map, which a restart empties. The
/// staged dir's `goal` file (`goal_id\ntask_id`, written by [`stage_peer`])
/// survives; when its task-id line matches THIS row (or is blank — the file
/// predates the task-id column), the sweep re-stashes the binding via
/// [`default_agent_orchestrator().record_goal_task_registration`] FIRST, so
/// the adoption's terminal transition settles the goal ledger row instead of
/// leaving it `running` forever. That recorder is idempotent per task id
/// (re-stash installs a fresh generation), so double-binding is safe.
///
/// `TaskStatus::Parked` is NOT terminal, so `mark_completed` is the legal,
/// documented adoption path. Filtering on `status == Parked` makes the sweep
/// naturally idempotent: an already-adopted (Completed) row is skipped on any
/// later restore instead of re-marking a terminal task. Returns the number of
/// tasks adopted. A parked peer WITHOUT a result stays `Parked` (debug log
/// only) — the client may still adopt it. Ungated (unlike
/// [`bind_peer_supervised_task`]): the gateway session actor wires it without
/// the `api` feature.
///
/// #15 RA-4 — ORIGINATOR-LESS FALLBACK contract: when the staged dir carries
/// no `originator` leaf (legacy staging predating #14's binding files), the
/// adoption falls back to comparing the ROW's `parent_session_key` against
/// `expected_master_session` — so the caller MUST pass the master session

//   * execution's ONLY current-state authorities are (a) the `closed` marker
//     and (b) a TRUSTED read-only projection of `lifetime.json`. There is NO
//     parallel state file and NO derivation from `turns.txt` — an old
//     terminal outcome proves the PAST, never the present (that inference is
//     precisely the stale-done bug this task fixes, in the other direction).
//   * `last_outcome` comes from a STRICT cross-check of the last `turns.txt`
//     entry against the highest-numbered `result-<n>.md` frontmatter
//     (independent reader — the lenient legacy parser stays untouched for
//     its existing consumers). Mismatch ⇒ null: the two native terminal
//     records disagree, so no outcome is asserted.
//   * Trust is fail-closed and typed (see recovery.rs
//     `trusted_lifetime_projection`): reuses PeerLifetime's strict enum and
//     Option field types instead of a hand-rolled serde_json validator, adds
//     the registry_key check and the Idle digest re-computation. Any failure
//     degrades the peer to execution=unknown AND nulls the identity fields.
