//! TTL/LRU cache for per-session runtimes.
//!
//! See the crate-level [`super`] module docs and
//! `docs/M11-PROFILE-SESSION-RUNTIME-ADR.md`. This file owns the
//! [`SessionRuntimeCache`] type. The cache is intentionally a
//! performance optimization: every entry is reconstructible from the
//! parent [`ProfileRuntime`] + on-disk session metadata, so eviction
//! is always safe.
//!
//! M11-A shipped only `new` and `invalidate`. M11-C fills in the
//! `get_or_init` body, the background-sweep task, and the LRU soft-cap
//! eviction.
