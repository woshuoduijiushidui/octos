///
/// **Why this constant exists.** `EpisodeStore::find_relevant_hybrid` returns
/// the top-K episodes by hybrid score regardless of how relevant they
/// actually are. With an empty or sparsely populated query domain, the top
/// match can still have a near-zero score — yet the agent loop used to
/// inject it as a "Relevant Past Experience". This contaminated unrelated
/// sessions (round-2 soak NEW-06: a JWST research prompt was answered using
/// episodes from a prior Tim Cook / GPT-5.5 podcast session).
///
/// **History.** 0.35 was the original codex-recommended baseline introduced
/// in PR #1192. Round-3 soak (2026-05-23) showed it was still too lax —
/// 3 of 4 minis (mini1/mini2/mini5) returned contaminated content on a
/// JWST prompt (Apple CEO / GPT-5.5 / agentic-AI-history episodes leaked
/// through). Only mini3 stayed on-topic. The cross-session noise floor
/// at 0.35 is high enough that fuzzy BM25/cosine overlaps between
/// *unrelated* topic domains still clear the gate. Tightening to 0.55
/// requires a substantially closer semantic match — keyword-perfect
/// (BM25 1.0) or genuinely on-topic vector hits still pass, but loose
/// "both mention some shared token" noise no longer does.
///
/// **Modality-aware gating.** The gate is compared against
/// [`HybridScore::best_modality`] (the max of BM25 and vector), not
/// against the configured weighted-sum `combined` score. Otherwise a
/// keyword-perfect match scoring `1.0` on BM25 would be capped at
/// `bm25_weight` (`0.3` with defaults) when an embedder is configured,
/// and the gate would always strand legitimately relevant single-modality
/// matches (older episodes without embeddings, or queries that don't
