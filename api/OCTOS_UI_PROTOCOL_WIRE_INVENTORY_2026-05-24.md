# Octos UI Protocol Wire Inventory

Status: current inventory for Octos issue #716
Date: 2026-05-24
Protocol: `octos-ui/v1alpha1`

This inventory reconciles the shipped AppUI/UI Protocol wire surface with the
spec and UPCR documents. The authoritative source remains code:

- commands: `crates/octos-core/src/ui_protocol.rs::UI_PROTOCOL_COMMAND_METHODS`,
  `UI_PROTOCOL_FIRST_SERVER_METHODS`, plus
  `crates/octos-cli/src/api/ui_protocol_transport.rs::APPUI_EXTRA_METHODS`
- notifications:
  `crates/octos-core/src/ui_protocol.rs::UI_PROTOCOL_NOTIFICATION_METHODS`
- executable route fixture:
  `e2e/fixtures/appui-conformance/m18-route-inventory.json`
- parity runner:
  `e2e/scripts/m18-appui-transport-parity-soak.mjs`

> **Audit note (2026-08-21):** commands were backfilled from the code constants of
> truth (`UI_PROTOCOL_COMMAND_METHODS` in `crates/octos-core/src/ui_protocol.rs` plus
> `APPUI_EXTRA_METHODS`). Notifications above are now the full
> `UI_PROTOCOL_NOTIFICATION_METHODS` list. `message/persisted` (UPCR-2026-012) was
> **retired**: the ledger explicitly skips it (`ui_protocol_ledger.rs:1001`) and tests
> assert no new frame carries it; its successor is `projection/envelope`.

## Reconciliation Decisions

- UPCR-2026-001, UPCR-2026-002, and UPCR-2026-003 are restored as accepted
  documents because the spec linked them and code already ships their surfaces.
- `approval/scopes/list`, `approval/auto_resolved`, `approval/decided`,
  `approval/cancelled`, `progress/updated`, and `protocol/replay_lossy` are
  documented as shipped wire-visible methods/notifications rather than
  internal implementation details.
- `onboarding/workspace_probe` is added to the executable route inventory
  because `APPUI_EXTRA_METHODS` advertises it for local-solo deployments.
- `onboarding/workspace_list` and `onboarding/workspace_create` join it for
  the same reason: `APPUI_EXTRA_METHODS` advertises both for local-solo
  deployments, behind the `onboarding.workspace_browse.v1` feature advertised
  next to `onboarding.workspace_probe.v1`. Tenant/cloud deployments advertise
  neither the methods nor the feature, and refuse a direct call with
  `profile_local_unsupported`.
- `auth/logout` and all `content/*` methods are recorded as auth-bound
  unavailable over unauthenticated stdio, matching
  `APPUI_STDIO_AUTH_BOUND_UNAVAILABLE_METHODS`.
